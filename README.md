# Taste U
Elegant recipe explorer for midnight cravings.

## Project

Web app that consists in a recipe browser, consuming the [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) API. It is possible to generate queries through the interface and browse the displayed results dynamically. When accessing a recipe, more details like ingredients and instructions, are shown. Additionally, random recipes can be queried, for the indecisive user.
